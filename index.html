                    <p>The US men’s national team qualified for the World Cup in Qatar last night after failing to do so in 2018. All they had to do was not lose by six goals against Costa Rica, and they managed to only lose by two</p>

                    <p>Zuck’s been watching a little too much House of Cards. According to a Washington Post report, Meta hired a top Republican consulting firm to help spread negative messages about rival TikTok in a campaign reminiscent of Frank Underwood’s political schemes.</p>
